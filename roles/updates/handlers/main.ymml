# remeber we have used register to hold the changes in a variable
# now we will use "notify" to do this if we use this and any change have been done it will run the specific task
#
# syntax :
# 
# notify: restart_apache
#
# this will be written under roles/base/tasks/main.yml file 

- name: restart_apache
  service:
